# The DeFi App

The DeFi App was built to show the usage of the most popular android libraries

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Android new ui kit
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Asynchronism
- [Jetpack DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Replacement for SharedPreferences
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Dependency Injection
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - Persistence

## Installation

You need latest [Android Studio Canary](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview)
The first time you run the app it will ask for an ETH Address, you can use below address. I found it in the blockchain.
